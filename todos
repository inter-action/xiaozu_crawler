Scala 来做这部分吧
爬下小组饭网站-将信息存储到mongodb,
之后nodejs,angular写个前端，将订单信息汇总,之后由服务端发送个订单的批处理脚本，去远程下单

# httpclient
    ## connection settings
        HTTP/1.1 states that HTTP connections can be re-used for multiple requests per default. 
        HTTP/1.0 compliant endpoints can also use a mechanism to explicitly communicate their preference to keep connection 
        alive and use it for multiple requests. HTTP agents can also keep idle connections alive for 
        a certain period time in case a connection to the same target host is needed for subsequent requests. The ability to 
        keep connections alive is usually refered to as connection persistence. HttpClient fully supports connection persistence.
            就是说能够再一次请求完之后不断开的链接就是一个持久化的链接

        ### HTTP connection routing
            httpclient支持多个hop(即指定的访问节点)的跳转链接(proxy chaining)

            #### plain routes vs tunnelled routes
                Plain routes are established by connecting to the target or the first and only proxy. 
                Tunnelled routes are established by connecting to the first and tunnelling through a chain of proxies to the target. 
        #### Route computation 
            httpclient 对 proxy chaining 的类支持
